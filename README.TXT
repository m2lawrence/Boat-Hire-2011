This is my Java 6 degree assignment from my first year in 2011 where I gained 90% at degree level. 
This Boat booking system enables the user to book 7 Standard Boats, 
5 Luxury Boats and works with while loops until all the arrays are filled. 
It then prints a ticket confirmation out when booked and if cancelled then it doesn't.
